# Amyloid Augury
## A personalized risk profiling tool for the earliest pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid

### Head over to https://amyloid-augury-batch.herokuapp.com/ and explore two distinct modes for risk prediction of pathogenic brain amyloid

##### In the cohort mode, a template of input features for the model can be downloaded, filled in where each row is a clinical trial candidate, then uploaded to the application. A sample test file is provided in this github repo, so feel free to download this .csv file and upload to the application for a test run! The application will predict risk (high or low) for pathogenic brain amyloid for each candidate. This model has been optimized for precision to decrease the number of amyloid negative candidates screened using PET imaging for Alzheimer's disease prevention trials, and showed a precision of 89% in a test cohort.


##### In the individual exploratory mode, you can change various input features that were most important in the model used for cohort mode. This condensed model will then give a prediction for individual exploration.
